// This in DOM 
// there is a special 'this' context for event handlers. If an event handler is called by an eventListener, 'this' will refer to 'event.currentTarget'.
// Usually devs will simply use 'event.target' or 'event.currentTarget' to access elements in the DOM, but 'this' would also do.

// example:

const button = document.createElement('button');
button.textContent = 'Click me';
document.body.append(button);

button.addEventListener('click', function(e){
   console.log(this);
})

// the above is the same as 
/* 
   button.addEventListener("click", function(e){
      console.log(this);
   })
*/

// Explicit Context
/* 
   In the prev examples the value of 'this' is determined by its context (global, in obj, in constructor, in DOM event handler).
   However, using 'apply' and 'call' we can EXPLICITLY determine 'this' reference.
   When to choose using 'call' over 'apply' and vice versa is not easy to define. It depends on the context of program.
   They are very similar-- they invoke a function with specified 'this' context, and optional args.
   The only difference between 'call' and 'apply' is that 'call' requires the args to be passed in one-by-one, and 'apply' takes the args as an array.

   example:

const book = {
   title: "Aivaly, my homeland",
   writer: "Fotis Kontoglou",
}

function summary(){
   console.log(`${this.title} was written by ${this.writer}`);
}

summary(); // undefined was written by undefined

// as we see since 'book' object and 'summary' function have no connection, invoking 'summary' by itself will only print undefined.
// ** in 'use strict' (strict mode) this would print 'Uncaught Error: Cannot read property 'title' of 'undefined' 

// by using 'call' and 'apply' 

summary.call(book); // Aivaly, my homeland was written by Fotis Kontoglou

summary.apply(book); // Aivaly, my homeland was written by Fotis Kontoglou

// in addition to being able to pass the 'this' context as the first argument, you can also pass ADDITIONAL arguments .

function longerSummer(genre, year){
   console.log(`${this.title} was written by ${this.writer}. It is a ${genre} written in ${year}`);
}

// with 'call' you pass additional values that are sent as additional arguments

longerSummer.call(book, 'narrative', 1949); // Aivaly, my homeland was written by Fotis Kontoglou. It is a narrative written in 1949

// lets try do the same with 'apply'

//longerSummer.apply(book, "narrative", 1949); // Uncaught TypeError: CreateListFromArrayLike called on non-object at <anonymous>:1:15

// that is happening coz with apply you have to pass every arg in an array

longerSummer.apply(book, ["narrative", 1949]); // Aivaly, my homeland was written by Fotis Kontoglou. it is a narrative written in 1949.
